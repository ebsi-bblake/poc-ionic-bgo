## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli) (for Ionic projects)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) (if applicable)

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file and add your environment-specific variables (if applicable).
   - Example:
     ```
     REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.example.com
     ```

## Running the App on the Web

1. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL provided in the terminal) to view the app in your web browser.

## Running the App on Mobile (Emulator/Simulator)

### iOS

1. **Open the iOS Project in Xcode**:

   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

   - This opens the project in Xcode.

2. **Run on an iOS Simulator**:
   - Select an iOS simulator (e.g., iPhone 12) from the top toolbar.
   - Press `Cmd + R` to build and run the app.

### Android

1. **Open the Android Project in Android Studio**:

   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

   - This opens the project in Android Studio.

2. **Run on an Android Emulator**:
   - Select an Android Virtual Device (AVD) from the list.
   - Click the green "Run" button to build and run the app.

## Building the App for Handsets

### Building for iOS

1. **Prepare the iOS Build**:

   ```bash
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

2. **Open the iOS Project in Xcode**:

   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

3. **Build and Archive**:
   - In Xcode, select a physical device as the target.
   - Go to `Product > Archive` to build and archive the app.
   - Follow the steps to upload the app to the App Store or export the IPA file.

### Building for Android

1. **Prepare the Android Build**:

   ```bash
   npx cap sync android
   ```

2. **Open the Android Project in Android Studio**:

   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

3. **Build the APK**:

   - In Android Studio, select `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)`.
   - The APK will be generated in the `app/build/outputs/apk/` directory.

4. **Build the AAB (for Play Store)**:
   - Select `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build Bundle(s)`.
   - The AAB will be generated in the `app/build/outputs/bundle/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Errors**:
  - If you encounter errors during build or runtime, try cleaning the build files:
    - **Xcode**: `Shift + Cmd + K`
    - **Android Studio**: `Build > Clean Project`
- **Outdated Dependencies**:

  - Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date:
    ```bash
    npm update
    npx cap sync
    ```

- **Platform-Specific Issues**:
  - Check the official documentation for [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/docs) for platform-specific troubleshooting tips.
